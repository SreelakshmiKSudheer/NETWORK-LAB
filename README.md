# NETWORK-LAB

This repository contains networking lab exercises implemented in **C language** as part of the Computer Networks Lab course. The programs demonstrate core networking concepts using socket programming, routing algorithms, and traffic management techniques.

## üìö Course Outcomes

- **CO1**: Use network-related commands and configuration files in Linux.
- **CO2**: Develop network application programs and protocols.
- **CO3**: Analyze network traffic using network monitoring tools.
- **CO4**: Design and set up networks and configure protocols.
- **CO5**: Simulate fundamental network concepts using a network simulator.
